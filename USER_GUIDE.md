# 📖 Flash UI Studio: User Guide

Welcome to the elite workbench for interface generation. This guide covers how to maximize the professional features of Flash UI Studio.

## 🛡 Security & Compliance Dashboards
When generating security interfaces, the Studio automatically injects a **Custom Alert Rule Builder**.
1. **Define Metric:** Select from simulated metrics like `Failed Logins`, `API Drift`, or `Latency`.
2. **Set Condition:** Use operators like `Greater Than (>)`, `Less Than (<)`, or `Equal To (=)`.
3. **Threshold:** Input the critical value for your rule.
4. **Save Rule:** Rules persist within the generated component's local state.
5. **Alert Banners:** High-severity alerts trigger a persistent, dismissible banner at the top of the dashboard.

## 🧪 Model Performance & Prompt Playground
For AI Operations dashboards, the Studio generates a **Multi-Model Comparison Lab**.
- **Prompt Input:** Use the large-format playground to test complex system instructions.
- **Model Selection:** Benchmark against industry leaders like `GPT-4o`, `Claude 3.5 Sonnet`, and `Llama 3`.
- **Side-by-Side Analysis:** Results are rendered in real-time comparison cards showing:
  - **Latency:** Execution speed in milliseconds.
  - **Token Usage:** Breakdown of input vs. output tokens.
  - **Quality Score:** A simulated 1-5 rating based on heuristic checks.
- **Visualization:** Integrated SVG/CSS bar charts provide immediate visual benchmarks of model efficiency.

## 💾 Managing Your Workbench
- **History:** Use the "History" button in the top bar to swap between different project sessions.
- **Focus Mode:** Click any dashboard card to enter **Focus Mode**. This allows you to interact with the dashboard in a distraction-free environment.
- **Exporting:** While in Focus Mode, use "Export Code" to get the raw HTML/CSS/JS for your developers.

## 💡 Pro Tips
- **Tab to Auto-fill:** Press `Tab` in the command bar to quickly cycle through high-fidelity prompt suggestions.
- **Surprise Me:** Use the Sparkle button on the landing page for inspiration on "Deep Space" enterprise aesthetics.
- **Variations:** If you like a layout but want a different "vibe," use the **Studio Variations** feature to regenerate concepts without changing your prompt.
