# ⚡ Flash UI Studio

Flash UI Studio is a world-class, professional-grade interface generation workbench. It leverages the latest Gemini 3 Flash models to transform complex enterprise requirements into high-fidelity, interactive React-style dashboard components.

## 🚀 Vision
To bridge the gap between "concept" and "high-fidelity prototype" for Staff Platform Engineers and Lead UI/UX Designers. Flash UI Studio doesn't just generate layouts; it generates **intelligent systems**.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Engine:** Google Gemini 3 Flash (via `@google/genai`)
- **Frontend:** React 19 (Modern functional components & Hooks)
- **Styling:** Professional-grade "Studio" CSS (Slate/Zinc palette, Glassmorphism, Ease-out-expo transitions)
- **Persistence:** LocalStorage-backed state hydration for offline-capable workbench history
- **Platform:** PWA (Progressive Web App) with standalone manifest support

## ✨ Core Features
- **Intelligent Studio Directions:** Every prompt generates 3 distinct conceptual directions (e.g., *Cybernetic Ops*, *Aero Dynamic*, *Neomorphic Lab*).
- **Interactive Rule Builders:** Deep support for Security and Compliance dashboards with metric threshold definitions and persistent alert systems.
- **Model Comparison Playground:** Side-by-side benchmarking for LLMs, including latency, quality scores, and token usage visualization.
- **Workbench History:** Full persistence of your design sessions, allowing you to return to any previous concept.
- **High-Fidelity Code Export:** One-click source code extraction for integration into production environments.
- **Studio Variations:** Generate radical alternative versions of any existing artifact without losing context.

## 📦 Project Structure
- `index.tsx`: Core application logic and Gemini API orchestration.
- `index.css`: Professional-grade design system and workbench aesthetics.
- `components/`: Modular UI units (Drawers, Cards, Backgrounds, Icons).
- `types.ts`: TypeScript definitions for the Studio ecosystem.
- `constants.ts`: High-density prompt presets and configuration.

## 🚦 Getting Started
